# Machine-Learning-Practice
This repository contains my machine-learning practice exercises and mini-projects.
Currently, I am studying from Sebastian Raschka's "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn" book. 
Most of the topics and code from this repository can be found in this book. However, all of the implementations present here were not directly copied from the book, but rather implemented after covering the relevant chapter.
